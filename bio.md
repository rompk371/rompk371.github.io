## About Me

Raised in New Jersey, I've lived in Dublin, Ireland and Brooklyn, NYC. I moved to a small city in Upstate NY to get some quiet and to be closer to nature. Being able to go on hikes after work and a slower pace has been life-changing. I currently work for the NY State government and am looking to return to the film and TV industry when I move to Sweden.

I enjoy painting and drawing, having studied art in university; playing with my two cats, Benny and Pudd'n; reading fiction; and keeping up on TV and movies. I'm a great teammate for pub trivia and Pictionary!

### Strengths
- Friendly and personable communication style (when appropriate), and the ability to adjust my style to the needs of the situation
- Translating difficult or confusing information 
- Ease with and enthusiasm for collaboration
- Reliability and punctuality
- Organization and prioritization of competing projects and deadlines
- Curiousity and an eagerness to learn

Currently learning: Swedish (Jag förstår lite svenska!), and web development with the help of OpenAI, Reddit, Youtube, and Github.
