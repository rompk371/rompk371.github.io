## About Me

Raised in New Jersey, I've lived in Dublin, Ireland and Brooklyn, NYC. I moved to a city Upstate to get some quiet and to be closer to nature. Being able to go on hikes after work and have a slower pace has been life-changing. 
I enjoy painting and drawing, having studied art in university; playing with my two cats, Benny and Pudd'n; reading fiction; and keeping up on TV and movies. Right now, I'm learning Swedish (Jag forstur lite svenska), and web development with the help of OpenAI and Reddit and Github.

### Strengths
